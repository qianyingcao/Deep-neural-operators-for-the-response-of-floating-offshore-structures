## Methods

* The performance of three neural operators is evaluated, namely, deep operator network (**DeepONet**), Fourier neural operator (**FNO**), and Wavelet neural operator (**WNO**). We investigate the effectiveness of the operators to accurately capture the responses of a floating structure under six different sea state codes (3-8) based on the wave characteristics described by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). To further enhance the accuracy of the vanilla versions of the neural operators, novel extensions, such as wavelet-DeepONet (**W-DeepONet**) and self-adaptive WNO (**SA-WNO**), are proposed. The codes for the novel extensions of the neural operators is uploaded in this repository.
